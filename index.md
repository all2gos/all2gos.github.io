## Experience

*Jan 2024 - now*

**Research Intern at Wroclaw University of Science and Technology** - I am currently engaged in exploring new methods of using artificial intelligence in theoretical chemistry working in a research team at Wroclaw University of Science and Technology

*Dec 2022 - Dec 2023*

**Quality Assurance Intern at Luxoft**  After a strictly chemical internship, I decided to try my luck in a strictly corporate job. At Luxoft, my job was to annotate data using the company's software. After a year, I can confidently say that I find myself more at this type of work. However, I missed the element of creative thinking or problem-solving. 

*Jul 2022 - Sep 2022*

**Intern at the Division of Nanomaterials Chemistry and Catalysis** My task was to carry out the synthesis of mesoporous inorganic supports, and to study the catalytic activity of the materials obtained. The work was geared towards the development of new synthesis procedures. I remember this summer internship very warmly.
