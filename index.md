## Experience

*Jan 2024 - now*

**Research Intern at Wroclaw University of Science and Technology** - I am currently engaged in exploring new methods of using artificial intelligence in theoretical chemistry working in a research team at Wroclaw University of Science and Technology

*Dec 2022 - Dec 2023*

**Quality Assurance Intern at Luxoft**  After a strictly chemical internship, I decided to try my luck in a strictly corporate job. At Luxoft, my job was to annotate data using the company's software. After a year, I can safely say that I have gained experience and find myself more at this type of work. However, I missed the element of creative thinking or problem-solving there.

*Jul 2022 - Sep 2022*

**Intern at the Division of Nanomaterials Chemistry and Catalysis** My task was to carry out the synthesis of mesoporous inorganic supports, and to study the catalytic activity of the materials obtained. The work was geared towards the development of new synthesis procedures. I remember this summer internship very warmly.
## Education
*Oct 2023 - Jun 2025*

## Projects

**RGBChem** - A method that translates chemical information into RGB images later used to train convolutional neural networks. [GitHub](https://github.com/all2gos/RGBChem) [Article](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/full/10.1021/acs.jctc.5c00291)

**PICle** - A procedure that, through the use of machine learning, makes it possible to predict the potential energy of bimetallic clusters and, as a result, analyze catalytic pathways without the need for expensive calculations. [GitHub](https://github.com/all2gos/PICle) [Article](https://www.mdpi.com/2073-4344/13/12/1470)

## After hours

I can solve a Rubik's cube in 6 seconds. I own the [28 fastest single solve](https://rankingi.rubiart.pl/rankings) of this puzzle in the entire history of the largest Polish Speedcubing Online League.

I love climbing üßó‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è, whether it's on the climbing wall (my hardest route ever done: 6b+ üí™) or out on the rocks (my hardest route ever done outdoor: 6a+). I prefer bouldering over rope climbing.

I like fiction books üìñ, my favorite authors are Andrzej Pilipiuk and Jacek Dukaj. Unfortunately, lately, I have a little less time for reading and in 2024 I have read only 7 books so far.

I enjoy playing board games: I gravitate towards board games that offer a sweet spot of complexity, allowing for strategic depth without drowning in rules. My favorite board game is Brass Birmingham (which is already quite complex by my standards). Alongside that, titles like Aquatica, Everdell, and Cascadia hold a special place in my collection. I even keep a ranking for my friends and family in which I have implemented the ELO system üòÖ
